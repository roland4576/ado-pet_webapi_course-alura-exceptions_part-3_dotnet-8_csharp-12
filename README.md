## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for anyone looking to improve their skills in C# exception handling. The course provides a hands-on approach, allowing you to work on real-world scenarios that require effective error management. Understanding how to handle exceptions can significantly enhance the resilience of your applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roland4576/ado-pet_webapi_course-alura-exceptions_part-3_dotnet-8_csharp-12.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd ado-pet_webapi_course-alura-exceptions_part-3_dotnet-8_csharp-12
```

Next, ensure you have the required tools installed. You will need:

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- A suitable IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)

Once you have everything set up, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Course Content

The course is structured into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of exception handling:

1. **Introduction to Exceptions**: Understand what exceptions are and why they matter.
2. **Throwing Exceptions**: Learn how to throw exceptions effectively in your code.
3. **Catching Exceptions**: Discover how to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.
4. **Creating Custom Exceptions**: Build your own exception classes to manage specific error types.
5. **Error Hierarchy**: Explore the hierarchy of exceptions in .NET and how to navigate it.
6. **Best Practices for APIs**: Implement best practices for exception handling in API development.

Each module contains exercises that reinforce the concepts covered. You can find the exercises in the `exercises` folder of this repository.

## Key Concepts

### Exception Handling

Exception handling is a critical part of any application. It allows developers to manage errors gracefully, ensuring that the application remains stable and user-friendly. Key concepts include:

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during runtime.
- **Finally Block**: The finally block allows you to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- **Throwing Exceptions**: Use the `throw` keyword to raise exceptions when certain conditions are met.

### Custom Exceptions

Creating custom exceptions can help you provide more meaningful error messages. This allows for better debugging and user experience. To create a custom exception:

1. Inherit from the `Exception` class.
2. Add any additional properties or methods as needed.
3. Override the constructor to include custom messages.

### Error Hierarchy

Understanding the error hierarchy in .NET is crucial for effective exception handling. Familiarize yourself with the following:

- **System.Exception**: The base class for all exceptions.
- **System.ApplicationException**: Used for application-specific exceptions.
- **System.SystemException**: Represents predefined exceptions that occur during runtime.

## Best Practices

When developing applications, following best practices can significantly improve your code quality:

1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than general ones to avoid masking errors.
2. **Log Exceptions**: Implement logging to track exceptions and gather insights for future improvements.
3. **Don’t Swallow Exceptions**: Always handle exceptions properly; avoid empty catch blocks.
4. **Provide User-Friendly Messages**: Ensure that error messages are clear and helpful for end-users.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages several technologies:

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **.NET 8**: The framework that provides the runtime and libraries.
- **ASP.NET Core**: Used for building the web API.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For data access and manipulation.
